describe what controls were added; operational detail that could narrow
an attacker's search space (which values lived where, timing of rotations,
remaining exposures) lives in internal notes instead of this public log.

## [Unreleased]

### Security (2026-04-23)

- Added a `gitleaks` pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that scans
  staged changes before every commit and rejects the commit on any
  finding. One-time setup per clone is documented in the README
  ("Local setup").
- Tightened `.gitignore` coverage to block additional secret-file shapes
  from slipping through (additional `.env.*` variants, typical key/cert
  file extensions).
- Refreshed `.env.example` so it enumerates every configuration key the
  backend reads today — new devs have a single authoritative reference
  and no reason to copy from a colleague's local file.
- Added `BACKLOG.md` to track infrastructure follow-ups queued for the
  next relevant deploy.
